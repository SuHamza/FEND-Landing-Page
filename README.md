# Landing Page Project

## Introduction

This project provides real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM, by building a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. 

## Project Files

- `js/app.js` contains all the custom JavaScript code to dynamically update the webpage.

- `index.html` contains the HTML to build the webpage's frontend.

- `css/styles.css` contains the CSS code to style the webpage's content

## Added Functionality

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. 

The following functionalities were added to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one:

- Dynamically create a **Navigation Menu** based on the sections of the page.
- **Section Active State:** While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top is distinguished from the other sections.
- **Scroll to Anchor:** When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls to the appropriate section.
- An an active state is added to the navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Added a **Scroll to Top** button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
